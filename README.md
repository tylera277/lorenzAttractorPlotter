# lorenzAttractorPlotter

Program which makes a simple plot of the Lorenz equations and with particular values plugged into those equations, can create a pretty Lorenz attractor plot. I utilized the 4th-order Runge Kutta method in order to evaluate the first order differential equations that are the Lorenz equations.
This being a Lorenz system,
